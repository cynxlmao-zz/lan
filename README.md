# Lan

Here's all the main code to Lan bot.

# How to setup the bot

`pip install dotenv`

1) Make a file named ".env". Put it in the same folder "discordbot.py" is in
2) In the file, make a variable named "TOKEN"

The .env should look like this :
`TOKEN = "bot token"`

It should work. If it doesn't, make sure you installed `dotenv` correctly or check if you made an error in the .env file.
